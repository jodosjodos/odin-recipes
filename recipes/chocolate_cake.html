    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix well until the batter is smooth and well combined.</li>

    <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, you can frost and decorate them as desired.</li>
    <li>Slice and serve this delicious chocolate cake!</li>
